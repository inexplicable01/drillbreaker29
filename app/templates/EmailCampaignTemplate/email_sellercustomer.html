        <p>Hi {{ customer.name }},</p>

        <p>Thinking about selling, but not sure if now’s the right time?</p>

        <p>Here’s a quick snapshot of what’s happening this week in your neighborhood:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>📈 {{ stats.new_listings }} homes listed in the past 7 days in {{ customer.maincity.City }}</li>
            <li>💰 Average sold price: ${{ stats.avg_sold_price | int  }}</li>
            <li>⏳ Homes are selling in just {{ stats.avg_days_on_market }} days on average</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you're even <em>thinking</em> about selling in the next few months, it’s worth chatting. I can give you a data-backed price estimate + strategy to sell fast — <strong>without paying 3% listing commissions</strong>.</p>

        <p>At <strong>Wayber</strong>, we help sellers keep more of their equity while still providing the full marketing, staging, negotiation, and paperwork support you'd expect from a top-tier agent — just without the bloated fees.</p>

        <p>➡️ <strong>Reply to this email</strong> if you'd like a quick, no-pressure walkthrough of how much you could walk away with in today’s market.</p>
